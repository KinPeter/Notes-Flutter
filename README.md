# Notes

Notes application for mobile written in Dart using the Flutter framework. The app is targeted for Android only at this point.
For backend I use Firebase (Auth and Firestore), which is also connected to one of my web applications, so I can manage the notes on both platforms. 

## Technologies used:

- Flutter
- Dart
- Firebase
- FlutterFire
